**A-star Algorithm**

The A* algorithm is a widely used and popular pathfinding algorithm in computer science and artificial intelligence. It is used to find the shortest path from a starting point to a target or goal point in a graph or grid, taking into account both the cost of reaching each point and an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal. A* is particularly efficient when applied to problems like route planning, puzzle-solving, and games.

**Heuristic Functions**

**Hamming Distance**
The Hamming distance heuristic counts the number of misplaced tiles in the puzzle compared to the goal state.

**Manhattan Distance**
The Manhattan distance heuristic sums the distances between each tile's current position and its goal position, considering only vertical and horizontal moves.

**Linear Conflict**
Linear conflict is an enhanced heuristic that takes into account conflicts between tiles in the same row or column that need to move in the same direction to reach their goal positions.
